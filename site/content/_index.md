  heading: Why?
  text: >-
    Are you tired of the old and tired red and blue politics? Me, too! And I can
    do better!  I'm starting a brand new government right here, right now. All I
    need is a nap. After that, a cup of coffee. And then I'll change the world.
    But I need your help.

    Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too – one
    of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives. We
    want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
