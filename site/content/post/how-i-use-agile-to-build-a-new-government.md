  Building government has typically been by violent revolution, waterfall, or
  the dreadfully long and hellish bureaucratic process that is the standard
  today. Here, I present my iterative method for building a government and

## My K.I.S.S. approach to Agile:

**The User Story**: Blah blah blah.

**The Backlog**: Feels the same as waterlogged.

**Measuring level of effort (LOE) in Story Points**: For realz? Just do it and shut up.

**Daily Standups**: Only when I feel like it.

**Deploying a working government**: Release once and we're done.
