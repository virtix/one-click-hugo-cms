## Let's not waste a bunch of time with a bunch of front-matter crap and get right to it with  DONT's:

* **Don't** **use pencil**. No one can read that shit
* **Don't plan**: Just write the first thing that comes to mind (see my Manifesto)
* **Don't tell the truth**: We only get attention when we totally exaggerate

**ProTip**: If you don't have time to make a sign, just grab something from your neighborhood; e.g., a For Sale sign or Garage Sale sign. It keeps people guessing.
